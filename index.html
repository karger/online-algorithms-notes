<h1>Experimental Class</h1> 

This is an experiment in online learning.  I've tried to turn my
lecture notes interactive.  As you read them, you will find questions
with boxes asking you for an answer.  Take a little time and see if
you can figure out the answer, and enter it. Once you've typed an
answer, click the adjacent button to proceed. 
<p>
If you've thought a bit and have no idea, just type a question mark in
the box and click the button.  Conversely, if you realize you already
answered a question in a previous box, just type "done" and proceed.
<p>
At the end of this exercise, there will be a "save" button for you to
click.  This will save a file containing your answers (with a weird
name; that doesn't matter).  Email it to me.  You will not be graded
on correctness, but you will get a participation grade for doing the
work.

<h1>Online Algorithms</h1>
    Motivation:
    <ul>
      <li> until now, our algorithms received entire input, then solved problem
      <li> (exception: data structures---we'll consider this later)
      <li> now, suppose input arrives a bit at a time, but we need instant
        response to each bit of info
        <ul>
          <li> e.g. stock market where I want to earn money over time
          <li> or paging where I want to avoid page faults over time
        </ul>
      <li> model as a sequence $\sigma$ of input &ldquo;symbols&rdquo;
        <ul>
          <li> algorithm must respond to each symbol
          <li> e.g. each day, a new stock market price.  do I buy or sell?
          <li> e.g., on each page fault, what other page do I evict to make room?
        </ul>
      <li> What is a &ldquo;good&rdquo; algorithm? depends what we measure.
      <li> Notice that on some inputs, you can't do well!
        <ul>
          <li> stock market that only goes down
          <li> paging task where every request is a new page (thrashing)
        </ul>
      <li> Instead, ask how we <i>could have</i> done
      <li> if knew whole input \(\sigma\) in advance, often easy to compute optimal response  \(C_{OPT}(\sigma)\)
        <ul>
          <li> Stocks: buy at low point, sell at high point
          <li> Paging: polytime exact algorithm (later)
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Example: the ski rental problem
      <ul>
        <li> each time you go skiing, you can rent skis for <span class="text2jax_ignore">$1</span>, or buy for <span class="text2jax_ignore">$</span>$T$.  
        <li> algorithm has to make a decision each time
        <li> which should you do?
        <li> problem: don't know how often we are going to ski.
        <li> What is optimal if you did know?
          <ul class="answer"> 
            <li>if you will go less than \(T\) times, rent each time.  Why?
            <li class="answer">since you end up paying less than \(T\) that way
            <li>otherwise buy at the beginning. Why?
            <li class="answer">since there's no point in ever renting if you will eventually buy
          </ul>
      </ul>
</p>

    <p>
      Definition: competitive ratio
      <ul>
        <li> Compare to full-knowledge optimum \(C_{MIN}(\sigma)\) 
          <ul>
            <li> algorithms \(A\) is \(k\)-competitive if for all sequences,  \(C_A(\sigma) \le
              kC_{MIN}(\sigma)\) 
            <li> sometimes, to ignore edge effects, define <i>asymptotically</i> \(k\)-competitive if \(C_A(\sigma) \le kC_{MIN}(\sigma)+ O(1)\).
            <li> generally don't look at additive approximation for same reason as in approximation algorithms: scaling makes them impossible
            <li>unlike approximation ratios, consensus that competitive ratio \(\gt 1\)
            <li> idea: &ldquo;regret ratio&rdquo;:  looking back on how you did, how bad do you feel compared to how you could have done
          </ul>
        <li> Murphy's law: assume an <i>adversary</i> is choosing the worst possible input sequence
          <ul>
            <li> Not necessarily the one with the worst outcome
            <li> Since adversary may also do badly on that sequence
            <li> Rather, one with worst outcome (for you) compared to optimal
            <li> We think of competitve analysis as a (zero sum) game between
              (your) algorithm and adversary.  Want algorithm with best strategy
            <li> Supposed to be competitive against all sequences. So, can
              imagine that adversary is adapting to algorithm's choices (to get
              worst sequence)
            <li>Adversary can be thought of as simultaneously designing the bad seequence and their (optimal) response to it.
          </ul>
        <li> Defines performance of algorithm without concern for runtime
          <ul>
            <li>might also want polynomial time algorithm (e.g., in length of \(\sigma\))
            <li>but this is generally secondary to being competitive
            <li>unlike standard sequential algorithms, where everything is trivial given enough time
          </ul>
      </ul>
</p>

    <p>
      What would be a competitive algorithm for ski rental?
      <ul class="answer">
        <li> what are the possible input sequences?
          <ul class="answer">
            <li>just one symbol: &ldquo;another ski trip&rdquo;
            <li>what matters is sequence length $k$
            <li>ie number of trips
          </ul>
        <li> what is the space of sensible algorithms?
          <ul class="answer">
            <li> rent for a while, then buy.  Why?
              <ul class="answer unwrap">
                <li> since once you buy, no point to rent
                <li> Only choice is after how many days to buy.
                <li> So, define algorithm by number of rent days \(d\) before buying
              </ul>
          </ul>
        <li> what are some obvious algorithms, and how do they do? 
          <ul class="answer">
            <li> How about buying skis on first trip ($d=0$)?
              <ul class="answer">
                <li>Murphy's law: break leg on first trip and never go again
                <li>I paid \(T\) while OPT payment is 1
                <li>competitive ratio \(T\)
              </ul>
            <li> How about renting forever ($d=\infty$)?
              <ul class="answer">
                <li>I become a lifelong skier
                <li>OPT is to buy skis immediately for \(T\)
                <li>I end up paying \(\infty\)
                <li>unbounded competitive ratio.
              </ul>
          </ul>
        <li> Given an algorithm from the space, what is its worst input sequence?
        <ul>
          <li> not the sequence where it has the highest cost
           <li> rather the one with the worst competitive ratio
        </ul>
          <ul class="answer">
            <li> If I rent \(d\) days and then buy, what is my (worst-case) competitive ratio?
              <ul class="answer">
                <li>while I rent, my ratio to opt can't get better
                <li>once I buy, my ratio to opt can't get worse
                <li>so worst ratio at moment I buy
                <li>my total cost is <span class="answer">\(d+T\)</span>
                <li>optimal algorithm knows whether to rent or buy depending on \(d\)
                <li>so pays <span class="answer">\(\min (d,T)\)</span>
                <li>so adversary can force ratio <span class="answer">\((d+T)/\min(d,T)\)</span>
                <li>minimized at <span class="answer">\(d=T\), yielding ratio 2</span>
                <li>above analysis also shows this is tight
              </ul>
          </ul>
      </ul>

      <h3>Finance</h3>

      General setting
      <ul>
        <li>I have something to sell
        <li>market price announced daily
        <li>I want to make max possible profit
        <li>given today's market price, should I sell?
      </ul>
</p>
    <p>
      Some technical conditions:
      <ul>
        <li>duration of game (number of days) might be known or unknown, but need signal on last chance to sell. Why?
          <ul class="answer">
            <li>suppose not
            <li>suppose I don't sell on day 1.  What is adversarial response?
              <ul class="answer unwrap">
            <li>adversary can sell on day 1 and close the market
            <li>I earn nothing---not competitive.
              </ul>
          </ul>
        <li>Need known min price \(m\) and max price \(M\).   Why?
          <ul class="answer">
            <li>suppose unbounded
            <li>suppose I sell.  What is adversarial response?
              <ul class="answer unwrap">
                <li>Tomorrow, Murphy will set price infinitely higher 
                <li>and optimal algorithm will sell the following day
                <li>not competitive
              </ul>
          </ul>
        <li>define \(\phi=M/m\)
      </ul>
</p>
    <p>
      Selling (one) car.  What's the best I can do?
      <ul class="answer">
        <li>suppose I sell one day at price \(p\).  What does Murphy's law say?
          <ul class="answer">
            <li>next day, price rises to \(M\)
            <li>and adversary sells
            <li>competitive ratio \(M/p\)
            <li>so, bad to sell at too-low price
          </ul>
        <li>So suppose I <i>don't</i> sell one day at price \(p\).  What does Murphy's law say?
          <ul class="answer">
            <li>adversary sells at \(p\)
            <li>All following days price is \(m\)
            <li>I sell on last day for \(m\)
            <li>competitive ratio \(p/m\)
            <li>so, bad to pass up a high price
          </ul>
        <li>OK, what's my best plan?
          <ul class="answer">
            <li>sell as soon as offer \(p \gt \sqrt{Mm}\)
            <li>this balances the two cases above
            <li>achieves competitive ratio \(\sqrt{M/m} = \sqrt{\phi}\)
            <li> analysis of cases above says this is best possible
            <li>since I'm in trouble if I ever sell for less or hold out for more
          </ul>
      </ul>

</p>
    <p>
      What if I have a large number of peanuts and can sell some each day?
      <ul>
        <li>Why might this avoid the bad cases listed for the car sale?
          <ul class="answer">
            <li>in car case, price rose the day after I sold it
            <li>with peanuts, if I sell some, I still have some left
            <li>So if price rises next day, I'm not doomed
          </ul>
        <li>So what should I do?
          <div class="hint">reserve some for sale at different prices.</div>
          <ul class="answer">
            <li> Break into \(\log \phi\) groups of equal amounts
            <li> Sell group \(i\) first time price exceeds \(m \cdot 2^i\)
            <li> One group sells for at least half of max occurring price
            <li> So achieve \(O(\log \phi)\) competitive ratio
            <li>If only \(\phi\) is known, can still apply algorithm.
              <ul class="answer">
                <li>on seeing first price \(p\), know possible range is \(p/\phi, p\phi\)
                <li>yields range of ratio \(\phi^2\)
                <li>so still get \(\log\phi^2 =O(\log \phi)\) ratio
              </ul>
          </ul>
      </ul>

      Back to the car.  Is there any way I can sell it in pieces?
      <span class="hint">Randomize!</span>
      <ul class="answer">
        <li>to simplify, can assume I will only sell at prices that are powers of 2 between \(m\) and \(M\).  Why is this reasonable?
          <ul class="answer">
            </ul>
        <li> Choose one at random
        <li> sell car at first bid exceeding that power
        <li> with prob \(1/\log \phi\), pick the power of 2 that is within
          factor 2 of highest offered price.
        <li> even if know \(\phi\) but don't know \(m\), can just run above alg
          after seeing first price
          Can achieve \(\log \phi\) randomized
      </ul>

      <h3>Load Balancing</h3>

      Definition:
      <ul>
        <li>\(m\) machines
        <li>jobs arrive one at a time with loads/processing times \(p_j\)
        <li>each must be assigned (permanently) to a machine
        <li>goal: minimize max assigned load (sum on a machine)
      </ul>
</p>
    <p>
      Propose an algorithm?
      <span class="hint">We've seen this problem before!</span>
      <ul class="answer">
        <li>This is just \(P||\max C_j\)
        <li>Consider Graham's rule
        <li>Always assign to least loaded machine:
        <li>Analysis same as before.
          <ul class="answer">
            <li> OPT has 2 lower bounds: average load and maximum job size.
            <li> Suppose \(M_1\) has max load \(L\), let \(p_j\) be last job on it.
            <li> claim every machine has \(L-p_j\) (else wouldn't have assigned
              last job to \(M_1\))
            <li> thus total load at least \(\sum p_i = m(L-p_j)+p_j\)
            <li> thus OPT \(\ge L-(m-1)p_j/m\)
            <li> so \(L \le OPT + (m-1)p_j/m \le (2-1/m)OPT\)
          </ul>
        <li>As we saw before, this is tight
        <li>many small jobs followed by one large produce large imbalance
      </ul>
</p>
    <p>
      Can we do better? 
      <ul>
        <li>e.g. approximation algorithm's LPT heuristic or enumeration PAS?
          <ul class="answer">
            <li>unfortunately these require all the jobs at once
            <li>to sort or enumrate
            <li>so not online
          </ul>
        <li>So for a long time, nothing better than 2-competitive (for large \(m\))
      </ul>
</p>    <p>
      But there has been progress:
      <ul>
        <li>algorithms not too bad, proofs messy!
          <ul>
        <li>Bartal et all '95 achieve 2-1/70=1.986: 
          <ul>
            <li>paradox: problem with graham is that is tries to balance everything
            <li>so keep some machines loaded slightly below average
            <li>So when a large job arrives, you can put it on an underload machine
            <li>seems like a small improvement, but significant to break factor 2
          </ul>
        <li>Karger et al '96: 1.945
          <ul>
            <li>consider several different "underloading" thresholds
            <li>solve a linear program to identify best mix of them
            <li>and to prove these can always be maintained as more jobs arrive
          </ul>
        <li> Albers '97: 1.923
      </ul>
      <li>Clearly none of these is the &ldquo;right&rdquo; algorithm
      <li>something simple is waiting to be found
</ul>
